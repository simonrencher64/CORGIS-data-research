	<p>
	Some of the details that the data has is the country that caused the explosion, the coordinates of the explosion, the reason for the explosion, how the explosion was set off, and the yield of the explosion.
 	The yield of the explosion is measured in kilotons. One kiloton is the energy released by 1000 tons of TNT. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The reason for the explosion can be a variety of things, some of them being combat, military training, for researching, or for weapons development.
